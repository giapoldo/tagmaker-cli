# TagMaker: The tag creation tool for samples and collections

## Description
TagMaker solves creation and printing of formatted data as a tag for samples bags or collections boxes

## Why?
The inspiration for this project comes from the need to quickly and effectively be able to print tags 
from tabulated data for sample bags and boxes in archaeological work. When you need to bag and tag 3000
of something by hand, you'll be VERY grateful for this.
